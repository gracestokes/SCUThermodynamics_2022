    "### Why do we use Python? \n",
    "Python is a widely used, open source programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Therefore, Python is commonly used in chemistry and biochemistry research labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the hashtags (#)? \n",
    "You will see the pound symbol (#) a few times in the cells below. This symbol is used to indicate a _comment_. When you use the pound symbol, everything to the right of it on the same line is ignored by Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if I don't finish my Notebook or try to work on it later this afternoon or tomorrow?\n",
    "<i>Something you will notice about Python is that when you hit \"SHIFT-ENTER\" or the \"PLAY\" button on the left side of a cell, the Python notebook only executes the current code block. This can have several unintended consequences. If you change a value and then go back and run an earlier code block, it will use the new value, not the first defined value, which may give you incorrect analysis. \n",
    "Similarly, if you open your notebook later, and try to run a code block in the middle, it may tell you that your variables are undefined, even though you can clearly see them defined in earlier code blocks. But if you didn’t re-run those code blocks, then Python doesn’t know they exist. It is a good habit to start over from the top of the Notebook and execute each cell if you leave and come back to work on it.</i></br>"

An example of this might be if we wanted to plot the polynomial from the previous cell. Suppose we wanted our plot to cover the range $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. We would need to calculate $y$ at a sufficient number of points (~20) for our plot to be smooth. It would be tedious to input 20 different values of $x$ and perform the calculation one-by-one. Luckily, Python has a few different functions that we can use to create numerical arrays. The one that we will use most frequently is linspace and the cell below introduces this function."

Python has a function, conveniently called plt.plot, which makes 2-D plots. The basic syntax of the plot function is (x,y,formatstring). So the first argument is for the horizontal axis, the second argument is for the vertical axis, and the formatstring argument will let you format your plot. For instance, if you want red circle markers you would type 'ro'. You will need to add one line of code to the cell below so that it plots $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$ as a red dash-dot line, and labels the x and y axes. Try it!  "
